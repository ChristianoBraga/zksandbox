# Z e r o  K n o w l e d g e _Sandbox_ 

The objective of this project is to help disseminate zero knowledge
technology. At first, examples of the application of ZK technology
will be posted. The long term is to have tools that will help adding
this technology to decentralized applications seamlessly.

Of particular interest is the use of the [Lurk](http://lurk-lang.org)
language, that allows zkSNARK circuits to be written as programs in a
Lisp dialect.
